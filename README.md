 ἔνθ᾽ οἵ γ᾽ ἄλγε᾽ ἔχοντες ὑπὸ χθονὶ ναιετάοντες
 εἵατ᾽ ἐπ᾽ ἐσχατιῇ, μεγάλης ἐν πείρασι γαίης,
 δηθὰ μάλ᾽ ἀχνύμενοι, κραδίῃ μέγα πένθος ἔχοντες. 

 and he made them live beneath the wide-pathed earth,
 where they were afflicted, being set to dwell under the ground,
 at the end of the earth, at its great borders,
 in bitter anguish for a long time and with great grief at heart.
 Hesiod, Theogony, 620
